<center><h1> <b>Design of Gurbani Vocab</b> </h1> </center><br />
<h3><u> Technical Design </u></h3><blockquote>
<h4>Gurbani Vocab is a piece of software created in Python designed to help students study Gurmukhi words. The program is structured as a
three-tiered web application. A web application is a piece of cloud hosted software which users can access via a browser.
<br></br><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='architecture.png')}}" style="float:right; height:240px; width:250px; border:5px black;"><u>User Interface Layer</u><br />
User interface is the visual display that a user sees in the browser. Jinja2 is the template language that allows Python code to be written 
and accessed from the user interface. The user interface itself is coded using a combination of HTML5 and CSS. Bootstrap - an open source HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript code library - was used to provide some complex graphic/styling elements.
<br></br><u>Logic Layer</u><br />
The primary logic is written using Python 3.5.2. The web framework that is used to build the web application is Flask. It handles HTTP 
requests, session management and encryption, etc.
<br></br><u>Data Layer</u><br />
The database - used to store and analyze data - is MongoDB. 
MongoDB is a No-SQL("schema-less") database that allows for flexibility within data structure. This flexible data structure was ideal for the application as
varying amounts/types of data needed to be stored for different users. MongoDB was accessed from Python via PyMongo. PyMongo is the reccomended Python driver for MongoDB.
Sensitive data such as passwords is encrypted in Python using Passlib - a password hashing library used in Python 
versions 2 and 3 - before being stored in the database.
<br></br><u>Cloud</u><br />
The web application is hosted in an AWS EC2 instance in the cloud.

<br></br><u>Data Schema</u><br />
Sample data schema from the "users" collection<br />

<h3><u> Functionality </u></h3><blockquote>
<h4>
Gurbani Vocab utilizes a list of the 330 most common words from the Guru Granth Sahib (Sikh scripture) that have been
divided into word lists of 15 for user convenience.
<br></br><u>Study</u><br />
The Study mode allows the user to view the entire list of words, definitions, and transliterations to study.
<br></br><u>Quiz</u><br /> 
The Quiz mode asks the user multiple choice questions about each word to test the user understanding of the definitions. The 
user's progress is stored in the database. 
<br></br><u>Progress</u><br />
User progress can be retrieved in either the Progress or Profile tab. The user can view the percent accuracy as well as all of the 
words they have answered incorrectly and correctly for each vocabulary list.
<br></br><u>Classes</u><br />
The user also has the option to enroll in a class using a class code assigned by a teacher user. This allows the teacher
to monitor the user's progress for each vocabulary list.
